# Integration-Project
An 100% product integration project for MES and WMS
# MES & WMS Integration Project in Turkey

## Project Overview
This project focused on integrating a globally used MES (Manufacturing Execution System) and WMS (Warehouse Management System) product into Turkey's operations. The primary goal was to optimize spare parts stock management and align operational workflows with the new system while ensuring uninterrupted operations.

## My Role
**Project Lead for Turkey Operations**  
As the project lead, I bridged communication between local teams and global product/tech teams, ensuring smooth adoption of the product.

## Key Responsibilities:
- **System Adaptation & Learning:** Mastered the new MES and WMS system by using an admin profile to fully understand its functionalities. Worked on adapting the system’s capabilities to our operational needs, ensuring smooth integration of new features, particularly for spare parts management.
  
- **Cross-Functional Coordination:** Managed the interaction between Turkey and Mexico’s product and technology teams to ensure a seamless integration. Acted as the point of contact for task tracking, roadmap execution, and resolving cross-functional issues.
  
- **Inventory and Process Management:** Conducted full warehouse inventory counts, registered items in a new QR-based system, and barcoded all spare parts. Conducted risk analysis on purchasing, technician workflows, and warehouse processes, adjusting these workflows for the new system. Oversaw the data migration process, working with tech teams to ensure no data was lost during the transition.
  
- **On-Site Implementation:** Traveled to Mexico to observe the product's field usage and coordinate further enhancements. Monitored and controlled the operational use of the product, ensuring alignment with business objectives.
  
- **Dashboard and Reporting:** Developed Tableau dashboards for real-time reporting on the system’s impact. Later transitioned reporting from Tableau to BigQuery, writing SQL queries to manage datasets and integrating these into Google Sheets and Looker Studio dashboards.
  
- **Training & Documentation:** Led the creation of documentation and training programs for technicians and quality teams, delivering hands-on training to ensure successful system adoption.
  
- **Issue Resolution & Continuous Improvement:** Addressed and resolved numerous operational issues post-launch, including system integration errors related to inventory entry, vehicle reservation, and work order management. Worked in the field directly with teams to troubleshoot problems without creating operational backlogs. Continuously collaborated with Mexico's teams to integrate system improvements through regular sprint reviews.

## Key Achievements
- Seamless integration of the global MES & WMS system into Turkey’s operations with no disruption.
- Successfully mitigated data migration risks and prevented data loss.
- Created operational reporting tools and dashboards that aligned with business intelligence needs.
- Trained all relevant personnel and ensured a smooth handover for day-to-day usage.
- Solved multiple critical issues that arose during the live operation, ensuring minimal downtime.
- Enabled continuous product enhancements by feeding back operational insights into the development process.
